## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Steganography Playground, please report it responsibly:

### How to Report
1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send an email to: [your-email@example.com]
3. Include a detailed description of the vulnerability
4. Provide steps to reproduce the issue
5. Include any potential impact assessment

### What to Expect
- **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Initial assessment within 1 week
- **Updates**: Regular updates every 2 weeks until resolution
- **Credit**: Public acknowledgment (if desired) after fix is deployed

### Security Considerations for Users

This tool is designed for **educational purposes**. Please note:

- **No Encryption**: Messages are hidden but not encrypted
- **Detection Risk**: Advanced steganalysis can detect LSB modifications
- **Format Preservation**: Use PNG for best results (lossless compression)
- **Browser Security**: Tool runs entirely in browser - no data uploaded to servers

### Best Practices
- Use strong passwords for any sensitive files
- Consider additional encryption before hiding messages
- Test steganographic images in your target environment
- Be aware of legal implications in your jurisdiction

## Responsible Disclosure
We are committed to working with security researchers to protect our users. We appreciate responsible disclosure and will work with you to resolve any security issues promptly.
